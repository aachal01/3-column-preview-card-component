## What I Learned

## What I Learned

During the project, I honed my skills in:

- Utilizing Google Fonts with the `@import` rule to style text uniquely.
- Implementing consistent box sizing using `box-sizing: border-box;`.
- Creating layouts with Flexbox, ensuring alignment and responsiveness.
- Applying color schemes using HSL values for a vibrant design.
- Enhancing interactivity with smooth hover effects using CSS transitions.
- Prioritizing mobile-first design and using relative units for responsiveness.
- Perfecting typography with properties like `font-family`, `font-size`, and `text-transform`.

This project provided hands-on experience with modern CSS techniques, reinforcing my understanding of web development essentials.
